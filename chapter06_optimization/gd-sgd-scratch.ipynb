    "In the previous tutorials,\n",
    "we decided *which direction* to move each parameter\n",
    "and *how much* to move each parameter\n",
    "by taking the gradient of the loss with respect to each parameter.\n",
    "We also scaled each gradient by some learning rate, \n",
    "although we never really explained where this number comes from.\n",
    "We then updated the parameters by performing a gradient step $\\theta_{t+1} \\gets \\eta \\nabla_{\\theta}\\mathcal{L}_t$. \n",
    "Each update is called a *gradient step*\n",
    "and the process is called *gradient descent*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hope is that if we just take a whole lot of gradient steps,\n",
    "we'll wind up with an awesome model that gets very low loss on our training data,\n",
    "and that this performance might generalize to our hold-out data. \n",
    "But as a sharp reader, you might have any number of doubts. You might wonder, for instance: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Why does gradient descent work?\n",
    "* Why doesn't the gradient descent algorithm get stuck on the way to a low loss?\n",
    "* How should we choose a learning rate?\n",
    "* Do all the parameters need to share the same learning rate?\n",
    "* Is there anything we can do to speed up the process?\n",
    "* Why does the solution of gradient descent over training data generalize well to test data?\n",
    "\n",
    "Some answers to these questions are known. \n",
    "For other questions, we have some answers but only for simple models like logistic regression that are easy to analyze.\n",
    "And for some of these questions, we know of best practices that seem to work even if they're not supported by any conclusive mathematical analysis. \n",
    "Optimization is a rich area of ongoing research. \n",

    "## Stochastic gradient descent\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the gradient descent algorithm may be infeasible when the training data size is huge. Thus, a stochastic version of the algorithm is often used instead. \n",
    "\n",
    "To motivate the use of stochastic optimization algorithms, note that when training deep learning models, we often consider the objective function as a sum of a finite number of functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(\\mathbf{x}) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i = 1}^n f_i(\\mathbf{x}),$$\n",

    "where $f_i(\\mathbf{x})$ is a loss function based on the training data instance indexed by $i$. It is important to highlight that the per-iteration computational cost in gradient descent scales linearly with the training data set size $n$. Hence, when $n$ is huge, the per-iteration computational cost of gradient descent is very high.\n",
    "\n",
    "In view of this, stochastic gradient descent offers a lighter-weight solution. At each iteration, rather than computing the gradient $\\nabla f(\\mathbf{x})$, stochastic gradient descent randomly samples $i$ at uniform and computes $\\nabla f_i(\\mathbf{x})$ instead. The insight is, stochastic gradient descent uses $\\nabla f_i(\\mathbf{x})$ as an unbiased estimator of $\\nabla f(\\mathbf{x})$ since\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbb{E}_i \\nabla f_i(\\mathbf{x}) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i = 1}^n \\nabla f_i(\\mathbf{x}) = \\nabla f(\\mathbf{x}).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In a generalized case, at each iteration a mini-batch $\\mathcal{B}$ that consists of indices for training data instances may be sampled at uniform with replacement. \n",
    "Similarly, we can use \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\nabla f_\\mathcal{B}(\\mathbf{x}) = \\frac{1}{|\\mathcal{B}|} \\sum_{i \\in \\mathcal{B}}\\nabla f_i(\\mathbf{x})$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "to update $\\mathbf{x}$ as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{x} := \\mathbf{x} - \\eta \\nabla f_\\mathcal{B}(\\mathbf{x}),$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $|\\mathcal{B}|$ denotes the cardinality of the mini-batch and the positive scalar $\\eta$ is the learning rate or step size. Likewise, the mini-batch stochastic gradient $\\nabla f_\\mathcal{B}(\\mathbf{x})$ is an unbiased estimator for the gradient $\\nabla f(\\mathbf{x})$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbb{E}_\\mathcal{B} \\nabla f_\\mathcal{B}(\\mathbf{x}) = \\nabla f(\\mathbf{x}).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This generalized stochastic algorithm is also called mini-batch stochastic gradient descent and we simply refer to them as stochastic gradient descent (as generalized). The per-iteration computational cost is $\\mathcal{O}(|\\mathcal{B}|)$. Thus, when the mini-batch size is small, the computational cost at each iteration is light.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are other practical reasons that may make stochastic gradient descent more appealing than gradient descent. If the training data set has many redundant data instances, stochastic gradients may be so close to the true gradient $\\nabla f(\\mathbf{x})$ that a small number of iterations will find useful solutions to the optimization problem. In fact, when the training data set is large enough, stochastic gradient descent only requires a small number of iterations to find useful solutions such that the total computational cost is lower than that of gradient descent even for just one iteration. Besides, stochastic gradient descent can be considered as offering a regularization effect especially when the mini-batch size is small due to the randomness and noise in the mini-batch sampling. Moreover, certain hardware processes mini-batches of specific sizes more efficiently."
