    "Before discussing the issues with gradient descent, let us take a moment to describe curvature and Hessian matrix of objective functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In one-dimension domain, a second derivative of a function indicates how fast the first derivative changes when the input changes. Thus, it is often considered as a measure of the **curvature** of a function. \n",

    "Consider the objective function $f: \\mathbb{R}^d \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ that takes any multi-dimensional vector $\\mathbf{x} = [x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_d]^\\top$ as the input. Its **Hessian matrix** $\\mathbf{H} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times d}$ collects its second derivatives with respect to different combinations of inputs and is defined as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{H}_{i,j} = \\frac{\\partial^2 f(\\mathbf{x})}{\\partial x_i \\partial x_j}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "for all $i, j = 1, \\ldots, d$. Since $\\mathbf{H}$ is a real symmetric matrix, by spectral theorem, it is orthogonally diagonalizable as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\mathbf{S}^\\top \\mathbf{H} \\mathbf{S} =  \\mathbf{\\Lambda},$$\n",

    "where $\\mathbf{S}$ is an orthornomal eigenbasis composed of eigenvectors of $\\mathbf{H}$ with corresponding eigenvalues in a diagonal matrix $\\mathbf{\\Lambda}$: the eigenvalue $\\mathbf{\\Lambda}_{i, i}$ corresponds to the eigenvector in the $i^{\\text{th}}$ column of $\\mathbf{S}$. The second derivative (curvature) of the objective function $f$ in any direction $\\mathbf{d}$ (unit vector) is a quadractic form $\\mathbf{d}^\\top \\mathbf{H} \\mathbf{d}$. Specifically, if the direction $\\mathbf{d}$ is an eigenvector of $\\mathbf{H}$, the curvature of $f$ in that direction is equal to the corresponding eigenvalue of $\\mathbf{d}$. Since the curvature of the objective function in any direction is a weighted average of all the eigenvalues of the Hesssian matrix, the curvature is bounded by the minimum and maximum eigenvalues of the Hesssian matrix $\\mathbf{H}$. The ratio of the maximum to the minimum eigenvalue is the **condition number** of the Hessian matrix $\\mathbf{H}$. "

    "Recall that gradient descent is a greedy approach that selects the steepest gradient at the current point as the  direction of advancement. At the starting point, the search by gradient descent advances more aggressively in the direction of the $x_2$-axis than that of the $x_1$-axis. \n",

Thus, gradient descent tends to overshoot the bottom of the function that is projected to the plane in parallel with the $x_2$-axis. At the next iteration, if the gradient along the direction in parallel with the $x_2$-axis remains larger, the search continues to advance more aggresively along the direction in parallel with the $x_2$-axis and the overshooting continues to take place. As a result, gradient descent wastes too much time swinging back and forth in parallel with the $x_2$-axis due to overshooting while the advancement in the direction of the $x_1$-axis is too slow.\n",
